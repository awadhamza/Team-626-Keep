# Restrospective Meeting Notes

## October 28th, 2019 (Labs 3 to 5), Scrum Master: Hamza Awad
- We took this time to become more familiar with using React & Firebase and how to set up the user interface. 
- We brainstormed what features made sense to incorporate and would make this tool the most effective. Since Google Keep is inherently a simple tool, we had a hard time coming up with features initially.
- We have come up with 12 user stories so far.
- The next challenge we faced was breaking down the features that we came up with into manageable tasks.
- Qie Jie and Shreya had the hardest time getting familiar with react since they'd never worked with the software in this kind of a setting before.
- Huzaifah, Katherine & Hamza began laying out the framework for the code.
- Katherine took the lead on developing the user interface.
- At this point we've established a functioning user interface, utilized Google Authentication for signing in/signing out, incorporated a home page and different tabs to navigate through the tool.
- The hardest thing so far has been trying to understand how different files will interact with each other and what functions are available to us as a part of React.
- We didn't accomplish as much as we had thought we would at this point in time so we've reassigned and restrutured our game plan for the completion of this project.

## November 18th, 2019 (Labs 6 to 8), Scrum Master: Shreya Kumar
- We realized some of our originally decided on features overlapped with other ones so we had to combine them.
- We finally figurerd out how to create a note object.
- It took a really long time to figure out how to store the notes in the database so that users can only see their own specific notes.
- We implemented adding/deleting notes. When a user adds a note it will show up for their specific account and when they delete, it will no longer appear.
- All bugs for that feature have been fixed and our user interface has been further refined so everything is nicer to look at and provides a nicer user experience.
- We've realized that the features we have implemented through the second sprint aren't complex enough.
- We brainstormed more features that are complex enough and in doing so some of our original design ideas have become obsolete.
- Communicating with each other throughout this entire process has made the second sprint a lot more smoother than the first sprint.
- For this second sprint we had decided to distribute the work amongst ourselves evenly but since everyones skill level varies a lot we've decided to distribute the work based off of what everyone can accomplish well.
- In this sprint, after the initial UI refinement, not much as been changed for the interface. Most of the work has been backend stuff.

## December 2nd, 2019 (Labs 9 to 10), Scrum Master: Huzaifah Simjee
- This sprint is where we accomplished the largest chunk of feature implementation.
- Once we got the hang of creating notes, adding features to those notes was less of a challenge.
- We're realizng now it would have been smarter for us to incorporate pair programming this way there would be less time being devoted to debugging.
- Our current feature list isn't as long as our original feature list, but it is more complex.
- We've been developing the code modularly which had made the debugging process easier and it's also made it easier for everyone to fulfil their respective tasks independently.
- There were some formatting issues that we faced but with the materials UI extension we were able to overcome that.
- As a group our progress is where we expected it to be. Using react and firebase was new to all of us but our improvement with working with these things has significantly increased as a group.
- We all had a lot happening outside of this class in this sprint but we made it a point to stay on top of communication to make sure that we weren't falling behind.
- Our hardest feature to implement has been uploading an image to the note but thankfully everything else has been taken care of.
- Overall we're very content with the end result that we produced.
