# Restrospective Meeting Notes

## October 28th, 2019 (Labs 3 to 5), Scrum Master: Hamza Awad
- We took this time to become more familiar with using React & Firebase and how to set up the user interface. 
- We brainstormed what features made sense to incorporate and would make this tool the most effective. Since Google Keep is inherently a simple tool, we had a hard time coming up with features initially.
- We have come up with 12 user stories so far.
- The next challenge we faced was breaking down the features that we came up with into manageable tasks.
- Qie Jie and Shreya had the hardest time getting familiar with react since they'd never worked with the software in this kind of a setting before.
- Huzaifah, Katherine & Hamza began laying out the framework for the code.
- Katherine took the lead on developing the user interface.
- At this point we've established a functioning user interface, utilized Google Authentication for signing in/signing out, incorporated a home page and different tabs to navigate through the tool.
- The hardest thing so far has been trying to understand how different files will interact with each other and what functions are available to us as a part of React.
- We didn't accomplish as much as we had thought we would at this point in time so we've reassigned and restrutured our game plan for the completion of this project.

## November 18th, 2019 (Labs 6 to 8), Scrum Master: Shreya Kumar
- We realized some of our originally decided on features overlapped with other ones so we had to combine them.
- We finally figurerd out how to create a note object.
- It took a really long time to figure out how to store the notes in the database so that users can only see their own specific notes.
- We implemented adding/deleting notes. When a user adds a note it will show up for their specific account and when they delete, it will no longer appear.
- All bugs for that feature have been fixed and our user interface has been further refined so everything is nicer to look at and provides a nicer user experience.
- We've realized that the features we have implemented through the second sprint aren't complex enough.
- We brainstormed more features that are complex enough and in doing so some of our original design ideas have become obsolete.
- Communicating with each other throughout this entire process has made the second sprint a lot more smoother than the first sprint.
- For this second sprint we had decided to distribute the work amongst ourselves evenly but since everyones skill level varies a lot we've decided to distribute the work based off of what everyone can accomplish well.
- In this sprint, after the initial UI refinement, not much as been changed for the interface. Most of the work has been backend stuff.
