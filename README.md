## Introduction

### Description: 

A web-based platform for note-taking developed by Google. On this web app, the user can write, edit, customize, and share their notes. The user can organize their notes by categorizing and archiving their notes. The notes are linked to the userâ€™s gmail account, so it can be accessed and modified everywhere. It can also be shared to other users using their gmail accounts for cooperative note taking. This app is based off of Google Keep and will be developed similar to its design.
